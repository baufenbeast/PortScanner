# PortScanner
QuickStart Port Scanner project
A quick project that scans ports 1-1025 of a given IP address, and tells the user which ones are open.
Either scan your own computer, or scan an intentionally vulnerable website such as one provided by HackTheBox.com.
Do not scan the ports of a non-consenting website, as they may view it as an attack.
